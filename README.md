# dummy_data_gen
Repo containing notebooks centred around for the creation of dummy data

## Reasoning

Repo exists as in modelling, and building of dev enviroments it's always useful to have dummy data. Creating from PROD data is ok, but this is a potentially simpler solution. Having worked in the insurance industry for most of my career this is more centric to that industry 

Repo contains notebooks from when testing out functions & a streamlit hosted app to generate data
